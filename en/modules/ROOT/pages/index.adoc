This website gathers all the courses offered by the {lv} CTI.

== What is the CTI

CTI stands for the Community Training Initiative and the idea is to make LabVIEW available to Anyone, Anywhere and it is as simple as that.

It is currently concentrating on open-source training materials and low-cost training platforms, hopefully removing the cost of entry to the world of graphical programming.

It currently consists of a website for the course materials (here), a downloadable virtual machine image with LabVIEW for Linux loaded (kindly hosted by https://gcentral.org/cti/[GCentral]) and firmware to convert a Raspberry Pi Pico into a SCPI VISA Instrument.

As mentioned before everything is open-source and hosted on our https://github.com/LabVIEWCommunityTraining[github page]

== Why the CTI

A software language needs a healthy eco-system to thrive, and back in late 2022 Steve Watts wrote an article exploring the sad state of the https://forums.ni.com/t5/Random-Ramblings-on-LabVIEW/The-LabVIEW-Eco-system/ba-p/4268997[LabVIEW eco-system]. In it he highlighted the poor support available for people just starting out their careers. Which led onto the high cost of entry to anyone wanting to put on a training course, which led onto the fact that only people with considerable resources could give a LabVIEW training course... this was a wrong that needed righting.

This problem was raised in a CSLUG Meeting in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbfEZv_zTSw[March 2023 from 56 mins] and discussed in a virtual coffee meeting in June 2023 where the VISA Pico firmware idea was discussed.

== Who's behind the CTI
The trouble with a list of contributors is I will miss important people out, github and the discord server is the best place for up to date info.

The initial idea was from Steve Watts who now works on hardware platforms and new course materials. The original course material was written by his daughter Poppy Watts.

Derrick Bommarito made the VISA firmware for Pico.

Georgios Tsalavoutis massively improved the Virtual Machine and gave us the logo.

Fabiola De la Cueva, Olivier Jourdan for re-organising the documentation.

Nancy Henson distilled the whole idea into "Anyone can learn LabVIEW Anywhere ðŸ˜Š", this really focussed the focus of the project
