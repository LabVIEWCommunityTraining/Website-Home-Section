. Administrator: to edit the `antora-playbook-en.yml` and all other existing languages (i.e. all `antora-playbook-xx.yml` files) to add the new project to the content list to build.

== Managing the content

=== Content organization

----
📁 _public <.>
📁 .github <.>
📁 course-material <.>
📁 www <.>
----

<.> This folder is used to store the automated built zip file of the content material. Do not remove it.
<.> This folder contains the action configuration used to build the content automatically
<.> This folder contains the course material i.e. LabVIEW code for exercices, examples, solutions and any other files needed to follow the course
<.> This folder contains the webdsite for all the languages

=== Set up the content the first time

When starting the project, do the following:

. Edit the `README.adoc` file with the useful information regarding your course.
. Edit the `antora.yml` file like described:
+
[source,yaml]

<.> Update the URL with the new project name. 

=== Edit the website content

The content of the website is written in text files using the Asciidoc syntax.

NOTE: The content is intended to be multilingual. Usually, we recomend to start with the English version to maximize the number of people being able to translate the content in different langages

    📁 en <.>
    📁 es <.>
    📁 fr <.>
    📁 zh <.>

Each language folder have the same hierarchy.

<.> file organizing the pages in the left sidebar

=== Standardization

As far as you can oragnize your course as you want, we encourage to keep a minimum of standardization between courses.

NOTE: We've been defining formating guidelines https://labviewcommunitytraining.github.io/www/en/contributing.html#writing-conventions[here].

NOTE: Always keep the Overview and Set up page and make them the two first page of your course 

== Building the content

Each time you push a modificaiton to the project, an automated task is triggered. This will do the following.

* Zipping and publishing the course-material folder
* Building and publishing the website
* Rendering the website content to a PDF file

NOTE: the zip file and the PDF are set to be downloaded from the overview page.
