<.> This folder contains the website for all the languages


=== Edit the website content

The content of the website is written in text files using the Asciidoc syntax.

NOTE: The content is intended to be multilingual. Usually, we recomend to start with the English version to maximize the number of people being able to translate the content in different langages

=== Standardization

As far as you can organize your course as you want, we encourage to keep a minimum of standardization between courses.

NOTE: We've been defining formating guidelines https://labviewcommunitytraining.github.io/www/en/contributing.html#writing-conventions[here].

NOTE: Always keep the Overview and Set up page and make them the two first page of your course 

== Building the content

Each time you push a modification to the project, an automated task is triggered. This will do the following.

* Zipping and publishing the course-material folder
* Building and publishing the website
* Rendering the website content to a PDF file

NOTE: the zip file and the PDF are set to be downloaded from the overview page.
